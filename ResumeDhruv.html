                I am keenly interested in technology and am continuously learning about software and hardware in my life. During the summer of 2014 in my freshman year, I enrolled in the summer program at George Mason University to advance my knowledge in Computer Science. I took the Multi-Platform Mobile App Development, Java I and Java II courses and gained exposure to Unity, Construct 2 and Java. In my Sophomore year at Oakton High, I took the AP Computer Science and scored 4. I keep up with tech blogs in my spare time and code often. I have a fair amount of experience with Java and some standard knowledge of HTML, Foundation, My SQL Database and Linux . I am a heavyweight rower on my High School rowing team (Oakton Crew) and have participated competitively in multiple regattas, including Stotesbury Regatta at Philadelphia, the largest high school regatta in the US.</p>
